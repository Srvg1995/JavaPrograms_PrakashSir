package lambdaexpression;
//This 'LAMBDA EXPRESSION' also called as 'ARROW FUNCTION'
//This 'LAMBDA EXPRESSION' introduced in JAVA 1.8(JAVA 8)version.
//LAMBDA EXPRESSION is applicable only for FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES.

/*
 We have 3 types of Interfaces,
1.Regular Interface:-Having multiple abstract methods(ie,list,set,queue,etc)
2.Functional Interface:-Having only 1 abstract method
3.Marker Interface:-Having No(0) abstract methods.
*/

/*
  ADVANTAGES OF LAMBDA EXPRESSION:
	1.We can provide multiple implementations using multiple lambda expression.
	2.We need to write implementing class.
	3.We need to write method declaration.
	4.We can pass method implementation as an input to another method.
